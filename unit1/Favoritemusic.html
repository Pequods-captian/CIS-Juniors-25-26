        <p>Heavy News By Bear Ghost is a song released in 2023 and is in their <b>album "Jiminy."</b> It is a <u>Adventure Rock song with themes of Misinformation and Evenromental Issues</u>, Bear Ghost themselves are a band based on the idea of creating  fun and quirky musicianship with complex melodies, phat harmonies, heavy riffitude, and pop structure.</p>
        <br>
        <h2>Lyrics and Meaning</h2>
        <p>One of the Main reasons I love this song so much is not only it's catchy melody and complex rythum but also that the lyrics have a deeper meaning than just being words said, <u>The Lyrics deal with themes of media manipulation, Misinformation and Enviromental Issues.</u> These can be very taboo topics when spoken about to certian people but they are unapologetically the themes of this song, Heavy News is the second tack in Bear Ghost's One of their Three Albums, Heavy News starts off with the dialog <i>"We interrupt your death metal to bring you some heavy news."</i> as a transiton from the pervious track, Then the real song begins.</p>
        <br>
        <h2>My personal experience with the song</h2>
        <p>I think the song is an absolute masterpiece with great harmonies and a complex melodie, And my absolute favorite lyric is "A passing asteroid's been glancing at our atmosphere."</p>
        <br>
        <h2>What You need to enjoy this masterpiece of a song.</h2>
        <ul>
            <li>A music streaming service, Spotify works best</li>
            <Li>A device, Like a phone or a laptop</Li>
            <Li><i>Headphones</i> (Optional)</Li>
            <br>
            <h2>Future Plans.</h2>
            <p>I hope to get more people to listen to this masterpeice so it can break into Bear Ghost's top 5 most listened to songs and hopefully dethrone "Necromanin Dancin."</p>
