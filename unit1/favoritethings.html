        <h1>Some Of my Favorite Media</h1>
        <br>
        <h2>Movies.</h2>
        <P>one of my favorite movies is the movie "Shin Godzilla." It was released in 2016 and It is much slower paced compaired to newer godzilla films as it takes itself more seriously and ffocuses on the human's beauocracy and their polotics as they try to face the new Kaiju threat, The godzilla in this movie is also designed to look very destrubing with it evolving and adapting to it's new circumstances as it continues it's rampage.</P>

        <h2>Video Games</h2>
        <p>A videogame I continue to find myself going back to over and over no matter how much i die and lose in, Is the 2018 Rougelike MetroidVania Dead Cells, I got into it when the Return To Castlevania DLC came out, It's a very addicting game with fast paced combat as you go through the levels of the island as the beheaded learning the story as you go on, a great part of it is that it often Colabs with other indie games adding new free weapons and outfits you can discover and unlock.</p>

        <br>
        <P>Another Game I find Great is the 2010 Action RPG Fallout New Vegas, It's got a pretty good story even though it's incredibly buggy although that's just Bethesda magic at work, The story takes place after You courier 6 was shot in the head and robbed of a very important item while delivering it, So after your life is saved by the local town's doctor, you have a new goal, Get Revenge </P>
